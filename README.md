One of the most important selling points for a company is customer support. If a company looks after the needs 
and problems faced by its customers, they gain a loyal consumer base. Customers also feel connected to the company if 
the company offers them support in case of any problems. According to the sprout social index: “40% of consumers 
expect brands to respond within the first hour of reaching out on social media, while 79% expect a response in the first 24 
hours.

Twitter has become one of the best platforms to contact customer support because it facilitates users to convey 
their problems and issues in brief so that the companies can understand and acknowledge the problem effectively. The 
messages of the customers contacting the company are open to the public so that the company is persuaded to give a quick 
response. The quick response of the company will give its customers a sense of satisfaction and will contribute to 
increasing the brand value of the company.

In this project, we analyzed the customer’s tweets to the companies and the company’s responses. We found a 
‘customer support on twitter’ dataset which contained the text of the tweets of the customers as well as the response of the 
companies along with the response time. We tried to understand the pattern behind the tweets to get appropriate response 
time by applying machine learning classification and regression algorithms. We did sentiment analysis of all the tweets to 
quantify the text of the tweet to make it easier for interpretation, visualization, and modeling
